# deep-person-reid
[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of deep person re-identification models.

We support
- multi-GPU training.
- both image-based and video-based reid.
- unified interface for different reid models.
- easy dataset preparation.
- end-to-end training and evaluation.
- standard dataset splits used by most papers.
- fast cython-based evaluation.


## Get started
1. `cd` to the folder where you want to download this repo.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid`.
3. Install dependencies by `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. To accelerate evaluation (10x faster), you can use cython-based evaluation code (developed by [luzai](https://github.com/luzai)). First `cd` to `eval_lib`, then do `make` or `python setup.py build_ext -i`. After that, run `python test_cython_eval.py` to test if the package is successfully installed.

## Models
* `torchreid/models/resnet.py`: ResNet50 [1], ResNet101 [1], ResNet50M [2].
* `torchreid/models/resnext.py`: ResNeXt101 [26].
* `torchreid/models/seresnet.py`: SEResNet50 [25], SEResNet101 [25], SEResNeXt50 [25], SEResNeXt101 [25].
* `torchreid/models/densenet.py`: DenseNet121 [3].
* `torchreid/models/mudeep.py`: MuDeep [10]. 
* `torchreid/models/hacnn.py`: HACNN [15].
* `torchreid/models/squeezenet.py`: SqueezeNet [18].
* `torchreid/models/mobilenetv2.py`: MobileNetV2 [19].
* `torchreid/models/shufflenet.py`: ShuffleNet [20].
* `torchreid/models/xception.py`: Xception [21].
* `torchreid/models/inceptionv4.py`: InceptionV4 [24].
* `torchreid/models/inceptionresnetv2.py`: InceptionResNetV2 [24].

See `torchreid/models/__init__.py` for details regarding what keys to use to call these models.

Benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md).


## Train
Training codes are implemented in
* `train_imgreid_xent.py`: train image model with cross entropy loss.
* `train_imgreid_xent_htri.py`: train image model with combination of cross entropy loss and hard triplet loss.
* `train_vidreid_xent.py`: train video model with cross entropy loss.
* `train_vidreid_xent_htri.py`: train video model with combination of cross entropy loss and hard triplet loss.

For example, to train an image reid model using ResNet50 and cross entropy loss, run
```bash
python train_imgreid_xent.py -d market1501 -a resnet50 --optim adam --lr 0.0003 --max-epoch 60 --stepsize 20 40 --train-batch 32 --test-batch 100 --save-dir log/resnet50-xent-market1501 --gpu-devices 0
```

To use multiple GPUs, you can set `--gpu-devices 0,1,2,3`.

**Note:** To resume training, you can use `--resume path/to/.pth.tar` to load a checkpoint from which saved model weights and `start_epoch` will be used. Learning rate needs to be initialized carefully. If you just wanna load a pretrained model by discarding layers that do not match in size (e.g. classification layer), use `--load-weights path/to/.pth.tar` instead.

Please refer to the code for more details.


## Test
Say you have downloaded ResNet50 trained with `xent` on `market1501`. The path to this model is  `'saved-models/resnet50_xent_market1501.pth.tar'` (create a directory to store model weights `mkdir saved-models/` beforehand). Then, run the following command to test
```bash
python train_imgreid_xent.py -d market1501 -a resnet50 --evaluate --resume saved-models/resnet50_xent_market1501.pth.tar --save-dir log/resnet50-xent-market1501 --test-batch 100 --gpu-devices 0
```

Likewise, to test video reid model, you should have a pretrained model saved under `saved-models/`, e.g. `saved-models/resnet50_xent_mars.pth.tar`, then run
```bash
python train_vid_model_xent.py -d mars -a resnet50 --evaluate --resume saved-models/resnet50_xent_mars.pth.tar --save-dir log/resnet50-xent-mars --test-batch 2 --gpu-devices 0
```
**Note** that `--test-batch` in video reid represents number of tracklets. If you set this argument to 2, and sample 15 images per tracklet, the resulting number of images per batch is 2*15=30. Adjust this argument according to your GPU memory.



## Visualizing ranked results
Ranked results can be visualized via `--vis-ranked-res`, which works along with `--evaluate`. Ranked images will be saved in `save_dir/ranked_results` where `save_dir` is the directory you specify with `--save-dir`.
